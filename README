put a script you want to run in screen in ~/bin/sm.available/
sm list
sm enable script
sm start script
sm {start|stop|restart|status|attach|list|enable|disable} [script]
(use with cron to (re)start it automatically at boot)

Screen Manager is a simple init-script like wrapper around GNU screen that lets users list, enable, disable, start, stop, attach applications. In combination with cron this can be used to start interactive applications like services in a screen on boot, and auto restart them if they crash.

Example Script: (prepare something and start it with exec)

pre. #!/bin/bash
cd ~/srcds/orangebox
exec ./srcds_run -autoupdate \
                  -game tf \
                  +ip 1.2.3.4 +port 27015 \
                  +maxplayers 24 \
                  +servercfgfile server_default.cfg \
                  +exec server_default.cfg \
                  +map cp_badlands

Example Cron Job: (restarts enabled scripts at boot and every 5 minutes)

pre. # m h  dom mon dow   command
@reboot /usr/local/bin/sm start
*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/sm start
